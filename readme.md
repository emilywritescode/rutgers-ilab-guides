## iLab guides

Rutgers has the Instructional Lab (known as the iLab), which is essentially a cluster of Linux machines. Typically, the coding assignments that you submit in class (CS211 and above) will be run and tested on the iLab (because architecture and weird differences in software, etc. vary among everyone's computers or whatever...)

So, it's a good idea to at least run your code on the iLab to make sure it works on there!

While the iLab has physical machines (which you can go up to in Hill Center on Busch campus at Rutgersâ€”New Brunswick), you can also access them via your own computer!

Explore the guides in this repository or [get started here (if you've never used the iLab)](getting-started.md).

These guides are written and maintained by various community members who have used the iLab themselves, so someone probably has the answer to your question! :)
