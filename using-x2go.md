## x2go

X2Go gives you remote access to an iLab machine. You'll see a desktop GUI where you can click on folders, files, open programs, and do mostly everything you could do as if you were really physically on the machine itself.

The Rutgers CS department has a pretty decent guide on how to install and setup x2go: https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/other/x2go/. If this guide ever leads to a broken link, or something's not working, free to ask any questions!

*Please note: Using X2Go is OFTEN buggy. Save your work early and often!!*
